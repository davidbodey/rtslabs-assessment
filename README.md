## Original Request:
Using the Javascript framework of your choice, build an application that has two pages users can navigate to:

* “/search” lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api).
* “/history” shows the users a list of their past searches from this session (these do not need to persist through refresh).
* Purpose: "...Javascript, querying an API, and state management. We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies. We don't care about design/UI (for this project)".
